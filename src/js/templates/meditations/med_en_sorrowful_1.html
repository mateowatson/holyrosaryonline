        <h1 class="label">Matthew 26:36-56 (RSVCE)</h1>

        <p><sup>36</sup>Then Jesus went with them to a place called
        Gethsem&prime;ane, and he said to his disciples, &ldquo;Sit here, while
        I go yonder and pray.&rdquo; <sup>37</sup>And taking with him Peter and
        the two sons of Zeb&prime;edee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.
        <sup>38</sup>Then he said to them, &ldquo;My soul is very sorrowful,
        even to death; remain here, and watch with me.&rdquo; <sup>39</sup>And
        going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, &ldquo;My Father,
        if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I
        will, but as thou wilt.&rdquo; <sup>40</sup>And he came to the disciples
        and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, &ldquo;So, could you not
        watch with me one hour? <sup>41</sup>Watch and pray that you may not
        enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is
        weak.&rdquo; <sup>42</sup>Again, for the second time, he went away and
        prayed, &ldquo;My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy
        will be done.&rdquo; <sup>43</sup>And again he came and found them
        sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. <sup>44</sup>So, leaving them
        again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same
        words. <sup>45</sup>Then he came to the disciples and said to them,
        &ldquo;Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is
        at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
        <sup>46</sup>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><sup>47</sup>While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve,
        and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests
        and the elders of the people. <sup>48</sup>Now the betrayer had given
        them a sign, saying, &ldquo;The one I shall kiss is the man; seize
        him.&rdquo; <sup>49</sup>And he came up to Jesus at once and said,
        &ldquo;Hail, Master!&rdquo; And he kissed him. <sup>50</sup>Jesus said
        to him, &ldquo;Friend, why are you here?&rdquo; Then they came up and
        laid hands on Jesus and seized him. <sup>51</sup>And behold, one of
        those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and
        struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.
        <sup>52</sup>Then Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Put your sword back into its
        place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.
        <sup>53</sup>Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will
        at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? <sup>54</sup>But how
        then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?&rdquo;
        <sup>55</sup>At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, &ldquo;Have you come
        out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after
        day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.
        <sup>56</sup>But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the
        prophets might be fulfilled.&rdquo; Then all the disciples forsook him
        and fled.</p>
