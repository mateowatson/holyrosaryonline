        <p><sup>20</sup>Now on the first day of the week Mary Mag&prime;dalene came
        to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had
        been taken away from the tomb. <sup>2</sup>So she ran, and went to Simon
        Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to
        them, &ldquo;They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not
        know where they have laid him.&rdquo; <sup>3</sup>Peter then came out
        with the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb. <sup>4</sup>They
        both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb
        first; <sup>5</sup>and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths
        lying there, but he did not go in. <sup>6</sup>Then Simon Peter came,
        following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying,
        <sup>7</sup>and the napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with
        the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. <sup>8</sup>Then
        the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw
        and believed; <sup>9</sup>for as yet they did not know the scripture,
        that he must rise from the dead. <sup>10</sup>Then the disciples went
        back to their homes.</p>

        <p><sup>11</sup>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept
        she stooped to look into the tomb; <sup>12</sup>and she saw two angels
        in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and
        one at the feet. <sup>13</sup>They said to her, &ldquo;Woman, why are
        you weeping?&rdquo; She said to them, &ldquo;Because they have taken
        away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.&rdquo;
        <sup>14</sup>Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing, but
        she did not know that it was Jesus. <sup>15</sup>Jesus said to her,
        &ldquo;Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?&rdquo; Supposing
        him to be the gardener, she said to him, &ldquo;Sir, if you have carried
        him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him
        away.&rdquo; <sup>16</sup>Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Mary.&rdquo; She
        turned and said to him in Hebrew, &ldquo;Rab-bo&prime;ni!&rdquo; (which
        means Teacher). <sup>17</sup>Jesus said to her, &ldquo;Do not hold me,
        for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say
        to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
        God.&rdquo; <sup>18</sup>Mary Mag&prime;dalene went and said to the
        disciples, &ldquo;I have seen the Lord&ldquo;; and she told them that he
        had said these things to her.</p>

        <sup>19</sup>On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the
        doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus
        came and stood among them and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo;
        <sup>20</sup>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his
        side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.
        <sup>21</sup>Jesus said to them again, &ldquo;Peace be with you. As the
        Father has sent me, even so I send you.&rdquo; <sup>22</sup>And when he
        had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, &ldquo;Receive the
        Holy Spirit. <sup>23</sup>If you forgive the sins of any, they are
        forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.&rdquo;

        <p><sup>24</sup>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not
        with them when Jesus came. <sup>25</sup>So the other disciples told him,
        &ldquo;We have seen the Lord.&rdquo; But he said to them, &ldquo;Unless
        I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the
        mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe.&rdquo;</p>

        <p><sup>26</sup>Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house,
        and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood
        among them, and said, &ldquo;Peace be with you.&rdquo; <sup>27</sup>Then
        he said to Thomas, &ldquo;Put your finger here, and see my hands; and
        put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but
        believing.&rdquo; <sup>28</sup>Thomas answered him, &ldquo;My Lord and
        my God!&rdquo; <sup>29</sup>Jesus said to him, &ldquo;Have you believed
        because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet
        believe.&rdquo;</p>
