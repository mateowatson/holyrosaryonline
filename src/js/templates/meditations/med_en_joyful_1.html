        <p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a
        city of Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man whose
        name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary.
        And he came to her and said, &ldquo;Hail, full of grace, the Lord
        is with you!&rdquo; But she was greatly troubled at the
        saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be.
        And the angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have
        found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb
        and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.</p>
