        <p><sup>41</sup>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
        Passover. <sup>42</sup>And when he was twelve years old, they went up
        according to custom; <sup>43</sup>and when the feast was ended, as they
        were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents
        did not know it, <sup>44</sup>but supposing him to be in the company they went a
        day&rsquo;s journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk
        and acquaintances; <sup>45</sup>and when they did not find him, they
        returned to Jerusalem, seeking him. <sup>46</sup>After three days they
        found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening
        to them and asking them questions; <sup>47</sup>and all who heard him were
        amazed at his understanding and his answers. <sup>48</sup>And when they saw
        him they were astonished; and his mother said to him,
        &ldquo;Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and
        I have been looking for you anxiously.&rdquo; <sup>49</sup>And he said
        to them, &ldquo;How is it that you sought me? Did you not know
        that I must be in my Father&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; <sup>50</sup>And they did
        not understand the saying which he spoke to them. <sup>51</sup>And he went
        down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them;
        and his mother kept all these things in her heart.</p>

        <p><sup>52</sup>And Jesus increased in wisdom and in stature, and in
        favor with God and man.</p>
