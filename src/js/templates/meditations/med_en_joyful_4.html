        <p><sup>22</sup>And when the time came for their purification according to
        the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the
        Lord <sup>23</sup>(as it is written in the law of the Lord, &ldquo;Every
        male that opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord&rdquo;)
        <sup>24</sup>and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the
        law of the Lord, &ldquo;a pair of turtledoves, or two young
        pigeons.&rdquo; <sup>25</sup>Now there was a man in Jerusalem, whose
        name was Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking for the
        consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
        <sup>26</sup>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he
        should not see death before he had seen the Lord&rsquo;s Christ.
        <sup>27</sup>And inspired by the Spirit he came into the temple; and
        when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him according to
        the custom of the law, <sup>28</sup>he took him up in his arms and
        blessed God and said,</p>

        <blockquote><sup>29</sup>&ldquo;Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace,<br>
        according to thy word;<br>
        <sup>30</sup>for mine eyes have seen thy salvation<br>
        <sup>31</sup>which thou hast prepared in the presence of all peoples,<br>
        <sup>32</sup>a light for revelation to the Gentiles,<br>
        and for glory to thy people Israel.&rdquo;</blockquote>

        <p><sup>33</sup>And his father and his mother marveled at what was said
        about him; <sup>34</sup>and Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his
        mother,</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising of many in Israel,<br>
        and for a sign that is spoken against<br>
        <sup>35</sup>(and a sword will pierce through your own soul also),<br>
        that thoughts out of many hearts may be revealed.&rdquo;</blockquote>

        <p><sup>36</sup>And there was a prophetess, Anna, the daughter of
        Phan&prime;u-el, of the tribe of Asher; she was of a great age, having
        lived with her husband seven years from her virginity, <sup>37</sup>and
        as a widow till she was eighty-four. She did not depart from the temple,
        worshiping with fasting and prayer night and day. <sup>38</sup>And
        coming up at that very hour she gave thanks to God, and spoke of him to
        all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</p>
