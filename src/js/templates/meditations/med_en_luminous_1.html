        <p><sup>13</sup>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be
        baptized by him. <sup>14</sup>John would have prevented him, saying,
        &ldquo;I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?&rdquo;
        <sup>15</sup>But Jesus answered him, &ldquo;Let it be so now; for thus
        it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness.&rdquo; Then he
        consented. <sup>16</sup>And when Jesus was baptized, he went up
        immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he
        saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him;</p>
