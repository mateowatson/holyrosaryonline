        <h1 class="label">Luke 2:41-51 (RSVCE)</h1>

        <p>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the
        Passover. And when he was twelve years old, they went up
        according to custom; and when the feast was ended, as they
        were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents
        did not know it, but supposing him to be in the company they went a
        day&rsquo;s journey, and they sought him among their kinsfolk
        and acquaintances; and when they did not find him, they
        returned to Jerusalem, seeking him. After three days they
        found him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening
        to them and asking them questions; and all who heard him were
        amazed at his understanding and his answers. And when they saw
        him they were astonished; and his mother said to him,
        &ldquo;Son, why have you treated us so? Behold, your father and
        I have been looking for you anxiously.&rdquo; And he said
        to them, &ldquo;How is it that you sought me? Did you not know
        that I must be in my Father&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; And they did
        not understand the saying which he spoke to them. And he went
        down with them and came to Nazareth, and was obedient to them;
        and his mother kept all these things in her heart.</p>
