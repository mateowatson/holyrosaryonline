        <h1 class="label">Luke 2:1-7 (RSVCE)</h1>

        <p>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that
        all the world should be enrolled. This was the first
        enrollment, when Quirin&prime;i-us was governor of Syria.
        And all went to be enrolled, each to his own city.
        And Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of
        Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem,
        because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be
        enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child. And
        while they were there, the time came for her to be delivered.
        And she gave birth to her first-born son and wrapped him in
        swaddling cloths, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place
        for them in the inn.</p>
