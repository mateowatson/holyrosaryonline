        <h1 class="label">Luke 1:26-38 (RSVCE)</h1>

        <p><sup>26</sup>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a
        city of Galilee named Nazareth, <sup>27</sup>to a virgin betrothed to a man whose
        name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin&rsquo;s name was Mary.
        <sup>28</sup>And he came to her and said, &ldquo;Hail, full of grace, the Lord
        is with you!&rdquo; <sup>29</sup>But she was greatly troubled at the
        saying, and considered in her mind what sort of greeting this might be.
        <sup>30</sup>And the angel said to her, &ldquo;Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have
        found favor with God. <sup>31</sup>And behold, you will conceive in your womb
        and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p><sup>32</sup>He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High;<br>
            and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David,</p>
            <p><sup>33</sup>and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever;<br>
            and of his kingdom there will be no end.&rdquo;</p>
        </blockquote>

        </p><sup>34</sup>And Mary said to the angel, &ldquo;How can this be, since
        I have no husband?&rdquo; <sup>35</sup>And the angel said to her,</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>&ldquo;The Holy Spirit will come upon you,<br>
            and the power of the Most High will overshadow you;<br>
            therefore the child to be born will be called holy,<br>
            the Son of God.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p><sup>36</sup>And behold, your kinswoman Elizabeth in her old age has
        also conceived a son; and this is the sixth month with her who was
        called barren. <sup>37</sup>For with God nothing will be impossible.&rdquo;
        <sup>38</sup>And Mary said, &ldquo;Behold, I am the handmaid of the Lord;
        let it be to me according to your word.&rdquo; And the angel departed from her.</p>
