        <p><sup>39</sup>In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill
        country, to a city of Judah, <sup>40</sup>and she entered the house of
        Zechari&prime;ah and greeted Elizabeth. <sup>41</sup>And when Elizabeth
        heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth
        was filled with the Holy Spirit <sup>42</sup>and she exclaimed with a
        loud cry, &ldquo;Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit
        of your womb! <sup>43</sup>And why is this granted me, that the mother
        of my Lord should come to me? <sup>44</sup>For behold, when the voice of
        your greeting came to my ears, the babe in my womb leaped for joy.
        <sup>45</sup>And blessed is she who believed that there would be a
        fulfilment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.&rdquo;
        <sup>46</sup>And Mary said,</p>

        <blockquote>&ldquo;My soul magnifies the Lord,<br>
        <sup>47</sup>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior,<br>
        <sup>48</sup>for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden.<br>
        For behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed;<br>
        <sup>49</sup>for he who is mighty has done great things for me,<br>
        and holy is his name.<br>
        <sup>50</sup>And his mercy is on those who fear him<br>
        from generation to generation.<br>
        <sup>51</sup>He has shown strength with his arm,<br>
        he has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts,<br>
        <sup>52</sup>he has put down the mighty from their thrones,<br>
        and exalted those of low degree;<br>
        <sup>53</sup>he has filled the hungry with good things,<br>
        and the rich he has sent empty away.<br>
        <sup>54</sup>He has helped his servant Israel,<br>
        in remembrance of his mercy,<br>
        <sup>55</sup>as he spoke to our fathers,<br>
        to Abraham and to his posterity for ever.&rdquo;</blockquote>

        <p><sup>56</sup>And Mary remained with her about three months, and
        returned to her home.</p>
